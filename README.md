The purpose of this repository is to showcase the alx C projects and other low level programming exercices that I have completed as part of my training. The repository includes a variety of topics, such as data structures, algorithms, memory management, system calls, dynamic libraries, and more. Each project folder contains a README file that explains the objectives, requirements, and tasks of the project, as well as the source code files and header files that implement the solutions. The code is written in C language and follows the alx coding style guidelines. The code is also compiled with gcc and tested with valgrind and betty-style.pl tools. The repository demonstrates my skills and knowledge in low level programming and my ability to apply them to solve real-world problems.
