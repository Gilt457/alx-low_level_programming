The purpose of this repository is to showcase the alx C projects and other low level programming exercices that I have completed as part of my training. The repository includes a variety of topics, such as data structures, algorithms, memory management, system calls, dynamic libraries, and more. Each project folder contains a README file that explains the objectives, requirements, and tasks of the project, as well as the source code files and header files that implement the solutions. The code is written in C language and follows the alx coding style guidelines. The code is also compiled with gcc and tested with valgrind and betty-style.pl tools. The repository demonstrates my skills and knowledge in low level programming and my ability to apply them to solve real-world problems.

The C programming language is a powerful tool for low-level programming and algorithm development. In this repository, I share the projects I completed as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program track on these topics. These projects helped me gain a deeper understanding of data structures, algorithms, and other fundamental concepts of low-level programming. Below is a summary of the projects included in this repository:

•	0x00. C - Hello, World

•	0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

•	0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

•	0x03. C - Debugging

•	0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

•	0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

•	0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

•	0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

•	0x08. C - Recursion

•	0x09. C - Static libraries

•	0x0A. C - argc, argv

•	0x0B. C - malloc, free

•	0x0C. C - More malloc, free

•	0x0D. C - Preprocessor

•	0x0E. C - Structures, typedef

•	0x0F. C - Function pointers

•	0x10. C - Variadic functions

•	0x11. C - printf 

•	0x12. C - Singly-linked lists 

•	0x13. C - More singly linked lists
